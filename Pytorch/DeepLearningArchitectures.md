<h1> Deep learning - architectures</h1>

Deep learning models come in different forms and architectures, risen from the specific task they were designed for. Image processing tasks required to identify patterns n images, and convolutional neural networks  are used to perform this task. Sequential tasks require to keep the flow of information through the sequence and recurrent networks are designed to handle it. For longer sequences,LSTM and GRU are invented. The transformers model then are introduced, capturing dependencies of each element across the sequence. 

This depository provides a summary of each architecture and implementation with Pytorch by providing a coding example.
