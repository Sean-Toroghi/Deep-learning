# New advancement in computer vision: overview

Since 2020, the field of computer vision has undergone transformative changes, largely driven by the introduction of transformer-based architectures and the consolidation efforts of projects like TIMM, which provide a unified reference for the community. These developments have spurred innovative approaches and steady advancements. While individual improvements may seem incremental and not headline-grabbing, their cumulative impact has been profound. In this repository, I compile a collection of these incremental enhancements that I have found valuable for modeling computer vision projects.

# ConvNeXt

The ConvNeXt is a backbone architecture was introduced in 2022 by facebook. The core idea behind ConvNeXt was to re-examine the design choices of traditional CNNs (like ResNet) and "modernize" them by incorporating design elements that have proven successful in Vision Transformers (ViTs), without actually becoming a Transformer.

Changes result in the ConvNeXT backbone architecture could be divided into two main categories: macro and micro. Next section provides a summary of improvement at each level.
## Macro level (high-level structure)

## Micro level (block-level structure)
