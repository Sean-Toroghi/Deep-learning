# Overview

Since 2020, the field of computer vision has undergone transformative changes, largely driven by the introduction of transformer-based architectures and the consolidation efforts of projects like TIMM, which provide a unified reference for the community. These developments have spurred innovative approaches and steady advancements. While individual improvements may seem incremental and not headline-grabbing, their cumulative impact has been profound. In this repository, I compile a collection of these incremental enhancements that I have found valuable for modeling computer vision projects.
