# Deep learning for computer vision

## Overview

Loss function
- continuous variable prediction: MSE 
- categorical variabel prediction: binary cross-entropy, or categorical cross-entropy

Feedforward propagation in code: a high-level strategy for coding feedfrward propagation is as follows:

1. Perform a sum product at each neuron.
2. Compute activation.
3. Repeat the first two steps at each neuron until the output layer.
4. Compute the loss by comparing the prediction with the actual output.
